Money Manager is a basic calculator that when given a toal will split it up into however many funds you provide with a percentage.
A doughnut chart will be generated as well based on the split with sections colored based on how big of a percent the fund takes up.
The darker the green the larger the percent. 
There is also a leftover section just to notify you if there is an impossible split that leaves 1 or 2 cents out.
